The Oracle of Bacon
===================

The goals of this assignment are as follows:

1. Give you more exposure to RSpec and to more advanced and idiomatic
Ruby programming

2. Introduce you to important technologies and libraries used in
service-oriented architecture, including parsing XML using XPath
expressions and calling RESTful APIs of a remote service

3. Get you accustomed to reading both RSpec code and Ruby app code.

Generally useful documentation pointers, in addition to those specific
to this assignment scattered throughout the handout:
