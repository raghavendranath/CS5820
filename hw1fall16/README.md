HW1 Fall 2016, Due Wed., Sept. 7 by 11:59 p.m.
=============

This 3-part homework provides some basic practice in Ruby as well as
accustomizing you to testing as a regular part of your workflow.

The code provided here follows a fairly standard Ruby convention: program
files are stored in `lib/` and the test files are stored in `spec/`.
(We are usng the RSpec unit-testing framework; if we were using Ruby's default
framework, known as `Test::Unit`, the test files would be under
`test/`.)

IMPORTANT NOTE:
Before starting this assignment you will need to install the ruby rspec gem in you cloud9
environment.  You can to this by entering the following command on the terminal:

`gem install rspec`

The starter code for the assignment is in `lib/ruby_intro.rb`. When you are done, you can
submit this single file to the ICON HW1 dropbox as follows:
1) in the Workspace menu along the left side of your Cloud9 window, right click on the
 lib/ruby_intro.rb file and select "Download".  This will download the file from Cloud9
 to the "Downloads" folder on your local computer.
2) Submit the downloaded file to the ICON HW1 dropbox.  

The files`spec/part[123]_spec.rb` contain RSpec tests for each of the three
parts.  For example, to test your answers to Part 1, use the command:

 `rspec spec/part1_spec.rb`

The command `rspec` with no arguments runs all of the tests in
the files `spec/*_spec.rb`.

* The line numbers in the RSpec error report will
give you guidance as to which tests failed.  (You can check the RSpec
documentation(http://rspec.info) to see how the `.rspec` file can be
used to customize the output format.)

* If you want to be really cool, run `autotest`.  This will run all the
tests in `spec/`, but every time you edit and save your code file, the
tests are automatically re-run, so you don't have to run them manually.
As we'll see later, this is the first step to TDD or test-driven
development: write the tests before you write the code, watch the test
fail, fill in the code and save the code file, then watch the test pass!
Before running `autotest`, you must first download some gems as follows:

`gem install rspec-autotest`

`gem install autotest-standalone`

Note: You will need to run `autotest` in a separate terminal window. To
terminate autotest, enter CTRL-C twice in rapid succession.

Here are the specifications for the functions you will need to implement
for this assignment:

# 1. Arrays, Hashes, and Enumerables

Check the [Ruby 2.3.0 documentation](http://ruby-doc.org) on `Array`,
`Hash` and `Enumerable` as they could help tremendously with these
exercises. :-) 

a. Implement a method `sum(array)` that takes an array of integers as
   an argument and returns the sum of its elements. For an empty array it should return zero.

b. Implement a method `max_2_sum(array)` which takes an array of integers as an argument and
   returns the sum of its two largest elements. For an empty array it should return zero. For
   an array with just one element, it should return that element. 

c. Implement a method `sum_to_n?(array)` that takes an array of integers and an additional
   integer, n, as arguments and returns true if any two elements in the array of integers sum
   to n. An empty array should sum to zero by definition.

You can check your progress by running:
 `rspec spec/part1_spec.rb`
or by running `autotest` and leaving it running.

# 2. Strings and Regular Expressions

Check the documentation on String and Regexp as they could help tremendously with these exercises. :-)

a. Implement a method `hello(name)` that takes a string representing a name and returns the
    string "Hello, " concatenated with the name.

b. Implement a method `starts_with_consonant?(s)` that takes a string and returns true if it starts
   with a consonant and false otherwise. (For our purposes, a consonant is any letter other than
   (A, E, I, O, U.) NOTE: be sure it works for both upper and lower case and for nonletters!

c. Implement a method `binary_multiple_of_4?(s)` that takes a string and returns true if the string
   represents a binary number that is a multiple of 4. NOTE: be sure it returns false if the string
   is not a valid binary number!


# 3. Object Oriented Basics

Implement a class `BookInStock` which represents a book with an ISBN
number, `isbn`, and price of the book as a floating-point number,
`price`, as attributes (instance variables).  

The constructor should accept the ISBN number
(a string, since in real life ISBN numbers can begin with zero and can
include hyphens) as the first argument and price as second argument, and
should raise `ArgumentError` (one of Ruby's built-in exception types) if
the ISBN number is the empty string or if the price is less than or
equal to zero.  Include the proper getters and setters for these
attributes.

Include a method `price_as_string` that returns the price of
the book formatted with a leading dollar sign and two decimal places, that is, a price
of 20 should format as "$20.00" and a price of 33.8 should format as
"$33.80".
